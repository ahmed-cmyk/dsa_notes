# Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. They are often simpler and more efficient than other approaches, but do not always yield the globally optimal solution.

## Time Complexity

Varies depending on the specific problem and data structure used.

## When to use

**When you have:**
- Problems where a local optimum leads to a global optimum
- Optimization problems (e.g., activity selection, Huffman coding)
