# Algorithms

This folder contains explanations and implementations of various algorithms commonly encountered in computer science and competitive programming, particularly those relevant for platforms like LeetCode.

Each algorithm is presented in its own Markdown file, following a consistent format that includes:

-   **Description:** A brief explanation of what the algorithm is and how it works.
-   **Time Complexity:** The typical time complexity of the algorithm.
-   **Implementation:** Placeholder code snippets in Python and JavaScript (and sometimes PHP) to illustrate the algorithm's logic.
-   **When to use:** Scenarios or problem types where the algorithm is particularly applicable.

## Included Algorithms:

-   Binary Search
-   Bubble Sort
-   Merge Sort
-   Quick Sort
-   Selection Sort
-   Depth-First Search (DFS)
-   Breadth-First Search (BFS)
-   Dynamic Programming
-   Greedy Algorithms
-   Backtracking
-   Dijkstra's Algorithm
-   Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
-   Prim's Algorithm
-   Kruskal's Algorithm
-   Topological Sort
-   Two Pointers
-   Sliding Window

This collection aims to provide a quick reference and foundational understanding for tackling algorithmic problems.
