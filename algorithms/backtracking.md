# Backtracking

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate (backtracks) as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

## Time Complexity

Often exponential, depends on the specific problem.

## When to use

**When you have:**
- To find all possible solutions to a problem
- Constraint satisfaction problems (e.g., N-Queens, Sudoku Solver)
