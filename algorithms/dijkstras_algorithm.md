# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It is widely used in network routing protocols.

## Time Complexity

O(E log V) or O(E + V log V) with a Fibonacci heap, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

## When to use

**When you have:**
- To find the shortest path from a single source to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights
