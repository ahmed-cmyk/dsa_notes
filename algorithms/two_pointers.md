# Two Pointers

The Two Pointers technique is a common algorithmic pattern that involves using two pointers (usually indices) to iterate through a data structure, often an array or a string. This technique is particularly useful for problems that involve searching for pairs, triplets, or subarrays that satisfy certain conditions.

## Time Complexity

Typically O(N) or O(N log N) depending on whether sorting is required, where N is the size of the input.

## When to use

**When you have:**
- Sorted arrays or strings where you need to find pairs or subarrays
- Problems involving linked lists where you need to find cycles or specific nodes
