# Topological Sort

Topological sorting for a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.

## Time Complexity

O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
