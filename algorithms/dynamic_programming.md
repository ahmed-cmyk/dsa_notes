# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems exhibiting properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

## Time Complexity

Typically polynomial, depends on the specific problem.

## When to use

**When you have:**
- Overlapping subproblems
- Optimal substructure
- Optimization problems (e.g., finding minimum/maximum values)
