# Depth-First Search

Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root (or arbitrarily selected node) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Time Complexity

O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

## When to use

**When you have:**
- To traverse a tree or graph
- To find a path between two nodes
- To detect cycles in a graph
