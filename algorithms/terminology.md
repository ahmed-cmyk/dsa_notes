# Terminology

**Linear Time**: Refers to when the running time increases proportionately to the size of the list.

---

**Logarithmic Time (O(log n))**: Occurs when the running time grows proportionally to the logarithm of the input size. Binary search is an example.

---

**Constant Time (O(1))**: An algorithm that takes the same amount of time to execute regardless of the input size.

---

**Quadratic Time (O(n^2))**: An algorithm whose running time is directly proportional to the square of the input size. Often seen in algorithms with nested loops.

---

**Big O Notation**: A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It's used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
