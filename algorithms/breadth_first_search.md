# Breadth-First Search

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

## Time Complexity

O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

## Implementation

## When to use

**When you have:**
- To find the shortest path in an unweighted graph
- To traverse a graph level by level
- To find all nodes within a certain distance from a source node
