# Bubble Sort

## Description

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements 'bubble' to the top of the list.

## Time Complexity

- **Best Case**: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)
- **Average Case**: O(n^2)
- **Worst Case**: O(n^2)

## Implementation

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater
            # than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

```php
<?php
function bubble_sort($arr) {
    $n = count($arr);
    for ($i = 0; $i < $n; $i++) {
        for ($j = 0; $j < $n - $i - 1; $j++) {
            if ($arr[$j] > $arr[$j + 1]) {
                $temp = $arr[$j];
                $arr[$j] = $arr[$j + 1];
                $arr[$j + 1] = $temp;
            }
        }
    }
    return $arr;
}
?>
```

```javascript
function bubbleSort(arr) {
  const n = arr.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
        [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];
      }
    }
  }
  return arr;
}
```

## When to use

- For educational purposes due to its simplicity.
- For very small datasets.
- When the data is almost sorted, as it can perform well in the best-case scenario.
